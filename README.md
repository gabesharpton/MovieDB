# MovieDB

## Technology

- React

This is a project I made to get better at pulling data from an API while using React JS. I pulled the data from TheMovieDB(TMBD) and did not show the files with the API calls as my API Key is attached. If you would like to see how I will gladly explain and show you the actual files. There is 2 components not pushed to git and it is a MoviesList and MovieDetail, List shows a grid view of movie posters and Detail shows the single movie detail. I also added React Overdrive for the animation.
