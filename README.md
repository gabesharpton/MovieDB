# MovieDB

## Technology

- React

This is a project I made to get better at pulling data from an API while using React JS. I pulled the data from TheMovieDB(TMBD) and had a hard time figuring out how to hide my API keys but was able to in my .env file! I also added React Overdrive for the animation.
